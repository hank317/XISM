# XISM: eXplanatory-Interactive Semantic Map  

XISM is a web-based semantic map generation tool that allows users to upload Excel files (form-function correspondence tables) to generate interactive semantic maps, supporting real-time editing and exporting images. Some useful links are accessible: https://juniperliuzhu.netlify.app/projects/SMM_demo.html 

## ✨Feature Overview  

- Upload Excel files to generate maps  
- Dynamic map editing  
- Interactive graphical interface  
- Evaluate map quality  
- Export maps as PNG images  

## ✨User Guide  

### 📁 Upload Excel File  

In the **Upload Excel File** module, click the **Choose File** button to upload the corresponding Excel file. Then click the **Upload and Generate Graph** button on the right to complete the file upload.  

#### 1️⃣ Excel Format Requirements  

If the Excel format does not meet the requirements, parsing may fail. Please ensure the file follows the specified format!  
You can click the **Download Guide** button in the lower right corner to download a sample template.  

##### 2️⃣ Data Sheet  

The data sheet must be placed in the first sheet of the Excel file for automated semantic map generation:  

- The first two columns of the data sheet must be named **languages** and **forms**. The **languages** column may be left blank, but the **forms** column must be filled.  
- The table must include at least two concepts (i.e., semantic units).  
- The table must include at least one form.  
- Only mark positions with **1**; all other positions default to **0**.  

##### 3️⃣ Ground Truth (Optional)  

The ground truth sheet should be placed in the second sheet of the Excel file to evaluate the generated semantic map against manual annotations:  

- The column and row names of the ground truth sheet must be identical and match the order of concepts in the data sheet.  
- Only mark positions with **1**; all other positions default to **0**.  

#### 4️⃣ Examples  

We provide three examples that users can directly use. Click the **ex** button to automatically generate the corresponding semantic map.  

- **ex.1**: "Eat" category words (Deng Shasha. A Study on the Semantic Map of "Eat" Category Words in Chinese Dialects[D]. Sichuan: Sichuan Normal University, 2020.)  
NOTE: This paper takes four forms of the verb “eat” — chi, qi, shi, and ye — in 42 Chinese dialects as the research object, and examines the regional distribution of the semantic items of these “eat”-type words. Their extended meanings include semantic categories such as “enter”, “understand”, “accept”,“suffer”, “bully”, and fear. The final semantic map involves 17 semantic values.

- **ex.2**: Adverbs of repetition (Guo Rui 2010, Supplementary Meanings of Adverbs and Semantic Maps of Related Meanings, International Symposium on Comparative and Typological Studies of Chinese Languages, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.)  
NOTE: Repetitive or additive adverbs mainly express the meaning of “repetition” (e.g., 这个电影我**还**要看一遍。I want to watch this movie **again**), or “addition” (e.g., 老师讲完生词**又**讲语法。After explaining the new words, the teacher then explained the grammar). However, in cross-linguistic examples, their meanings undergo multiple semantic extensions, such as indicating “reversal / restoration” (e.g., Can a person come back to life after death **again**?) or “even more” (e.g., 你急呀，我比你**还**急呢。You are anxious? I’m even more anxious than you). The semantic map involves 35 dialects/languages, 82 linguistic forms, and 18 semantic categories.

- **ex.3**: Ditransitive constructions (Guo Rui 2013, Ditransitive Constructions in Chinese from the Perspective of Semantic Maps, 21st Annual Conference of the International Association of Chinese Linguistics, Taiwan Normal University.)  
NOTE: A ditransitive construction refers to a structure where a single verb takes two object arguments and semantically involves the transfer of an item. The typical ditransitive structure indicates the meaning of “giving”, but it is not limited to this meaning. It may also express obtaining (e.g., took a book from him), adhesion (e.g., got oil all over my hands), damage (e.g., broke one of his legs), placement (e.g., put a book on the table), or benefactive receiving (to buy him a book). This paper investigates four possible ditransitive constructions in Chinese verbs that license such structures: V-N1-N2, V-give-N1-N2, V-N2-give-N1, and give-N2-V-N1. The final model covers 11 sentence patterns across 6 dialects/languages.

### 🖼️ Graph Demonstration  

The middle area displays multiple graphs, which are generated by the algorithm. Each graph includes an evaluation below.  

### 🪄 Graph Controls  

The **Graph Controls** module provides several functional buttons for interactive operations:  

#### 1️⃣ Edge Operations  

- **Add Edge**: Click this button, select two semantic nodes from the dropdown, and specify a weight to add a new edge.  
- **Edit Edge**: Click an edge on the map, then click this button to set a new weight and edit the edge.  
- **Delete Edge**: Click an edge on the map, then click this button to delete the edge.  
- **Merge Edge**: Click this button to automatically add edges from the bottom up, ensuring full-form connectivity and increasing the coverage of connected forms to 1.  

#### 2️⃣ Beautification Operations  

- **Center**: Click this button to center the semantic map on the canvas for a better overview.  
- **Beautify**: Click this button to re-render the semantic map with a more flexible custom layout.  

#### 3️⃣ Map Download  

- **Download Image**: Click this button to export the current semantic map as a high-definition PNG image.  

#### 4️⃣ Form Filtering  

- Click this button and select a form from the dropdown to highlight the corresponding semantic nodes in the map, allowing users to observe connectivity.  

### 📊 Evaluation Metrics  

Map evaluation includes the following eight metrics:  

- **Weight Sum**: The sum of edge weights.  
- **Degree Mean**: The average degree of nodes in the graph.  
- **Degree Std**: The standard deviation of node degrees. 
- **Coverage**: The coverage of connected forms among all existing forms.  
- **Productivity**: The proportion of actual forms among all possible forms. 
- **Accuracy**: The degree of alignment with expert annotations.  
- **Precision**: The proportion of predicted edges that match the ground truth.
- **Recall**: The proportion of ground truth edges that are correctly predicted.
- **F1 Score**: The geometric mean of Precision and Recall. 
- **Unconnected Forms**: Forms in the current graph that are not connected, helping users adjust the graph.
