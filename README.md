### 1. Upload Excel File  

In the **Upload Excel File** module, click the **Choose File** button to upload the corresponding Excel file. Then click the **Upload and Generate Graph** button on the right to complete the file upload.  
 
### 2. Graph Demonstration  

The middle area displays multiple graphs, which are generated by the algorithm. Each graph includes an evaluation below.  

### 3. Graph Controls  

The **Graph Controls** module provides several functional buttons for interactive operations:  
 
### 4. Evaluation Metrics  

Map evaluation includes the following eight metrics:  

- **Weight Sum**: The sum of edge weights.  
- **Degree Mean**: The average degree of nodes in the graph.  
- **Degree Std**: The standard deviation of node degrees. 
- **Coverage**: The coverage of connected forms among all existing forms.  
- **Productivity**: The proportion of actual forms among all possible forms. 
- **Accuracy**: The degree of alignment with expert annotations.  
- **Precision**: The proportion of predicted edges that match the ground truth.
- **Recall**: The proportion of ground truth edges that are correctly predicted.
- **F1 Score**: The geometric mean of Precision and Recall. 
- **Unconnected Forms**: Forms in the current graph that are not connected, helping users adjust the graph.   
 
### 5. Image Save  

After adjusting the graph, users can save it. Click the **Download Image** button to download the current semantic map.
